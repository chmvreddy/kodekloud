During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner. The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance. These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login


Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located at /tmp/nautilus_banner on jump host

1=== IN JUMP SERVER WE NEED TO APPLY THIS COMMAND TO MOVE FILE TO ANOTHER SERVER LIKE STAPP01
		jump_thor~# scp /tmp/nautilus_banner tony@stapp01:/home/tony/
		            scp /tmp/nautilus_banner steve@stapp02:/home/steve/
			    scp /tmp/nautilus_banner banner@stapp03:/home/banner/
			    scp /tmp/nautilus_banner peter@stdb01:/home/peter/


    1  ls
    2  sudo cat nautilus_banner >> /etc/motd       -- HERE I FACE AN ISSUUE UNABLE TO COPY FILE WHY BECAUSE THE OWNERSHIP IS DIFFERENT SO I CHANGED OWNERSHIP
                                                   -- OR WE NEED TO GIVE SUDO PERMISSION TO USER
    3  ls -la /etc/motd
    4  sudo chown -R tony:tony /etc/motd
    5  ls -la /etc/motd
    6  sudo cat nautilus_banner >> /etc/motd
    7  cat /etc/motd



NOTE:
