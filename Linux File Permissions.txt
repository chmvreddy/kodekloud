Some new requirements came up to automate a backup process that was done by xFusionCorp Industries system admins team manually earlier. To automate this task team has developed a new bash script xfusioncorp.sh. They have already copied the script on all required servers, however they missed to make it executable on one of the app server i.e App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.


Please give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 1. Also make sure every user should be able to execute it.


    1  cd  /tmp/
    2  ls
    3  ls -la
    4  ls -l
    5  chmod +x xfusioncorp.sh  
    6  sudo chmod +x xfusioncorp.sh
	sudo ./ xfusioncorp.sh
    7  ls -l
    8  cd
    9  history
    
    NOTE:
    =====
    1) LOGIN TO STAPP01 SERVER
    2) chmod +x --- IT WILL ADD EXECUTABLE PERMISSION TO XFUSIONCORP.SH FILE
    3) sudo chmod +rx xfusioncorp.sh
